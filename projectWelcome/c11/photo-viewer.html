 <!---  The HTML for the photo viewer consists of:
    • One large <div> element that will hold the main picture. The images that sit in the <div> are centered and scaled down if necessary to
    fit within the allocated area.
    • A second <div> element that holds a set of thumbnails that show the other images you can view. These thumbnails sit inside links. The 
      href attribute on those links point to the larger versions of their images. 
      
  USING THE PHOTO VIEWER - In order to use the photo viewer, you create a <div> element to hold the main image. It is empty, and its id 
    attribute has a value of photo-viewer. The thumbnails sit in another <div>. Each one is in an <a> element with three attributes:
      • href points to the larger version of the image 
      • class always has a value of thumb and the current main image has a value of active
      • title describes the image (it will be used for alt text)
