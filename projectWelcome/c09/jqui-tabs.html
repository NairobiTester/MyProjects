          <p>Second prize is the Arduino Robot - the first official Arduino on wheels! The robot has two processors, one on each of its two boards. The Motor Board controls the motors, and the Control Board reads sensors and decides how to operate. Each of the boards is a full Arduino board programmable using the Arduino IDE.</p>

<!--- The tabs are a similar concept to the accordion. 
1. They are kept in a containing <div> element that will be used in the jQuery selector. The content, however, is slightly different.
2. The tabs are created using an unordered list. The link inside each list item points to a <div> element lower down the page that holds 
  content for that tab.
3. Note that the id attributes on the <div> elements must match the value of the href attribute on the tabs.

  Once you have included jQuery and jQuery UI in the page, there is a third script tag with an anonymous function that runs when the DOM 
  has loaded.

4. A jQuery selector picks the element whose id attribute has a value of prizes (this is the containing element for the tabs).
Then it calls the •tabs() method on that selection.

This structure is common in most jQuery plugins:
1. jQuery is loaded.
2. The plugin is loaded.
3. An anonymous function runs when the page is ready.
The anonymous function will create a jQuery selection and applies the method defined in the jQuery plugin to that selection. Some methods will
also require parameters in order to do their job. · -->
