<!--- This example takes the content of the <input> and <textarea> elements and writes it into another part of the page (where you can see the 
  double curly braces in the HTML file). First, include the Angular script in your page. You can store it locally or use the version on 
  Google's CDN. Until you understand more about Angular, place it in the <head> element. Note the new markup in the HTML. There are attributes 
  that start with ng- (which is short for Angular). These are called directives. There is one on the opening <html> tag and one on each of the 
  form elements. The value of the ng-model attribute on the text inputs matches the values inside the double curly braces. Angular automatically
  takes the content of the form elements and writes it into the page where the corresponding curly braces are. 
No more JavaScript is needed to achieve this, whereas in jQuery, this would involve four steps:
1. Writing an event handler for the form elements
2. Using that to trigger code to get the elements' content
3. Selecting new element nodes that represent the postcard
4. Writing the data into the pageÂ·
