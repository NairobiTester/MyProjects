<!---- Creating an accordion with jQuery UI is very simple. You only need to know:
• How to structure your HTML
• What element(s) should be used in the jQuery selector
• The jQuery UI method to call
In this example, the HTML for an accordion is contained within a <div> element (its id attribute has a value of prizes, which will
be used in the script). Each panel of the accordion has:
2. An <h3> element for the clickable heading
3. A <div> element for the content of that panel
4 . Before the closing </body> tag the jQuery and jQuery UI scripts are both included in the page.
5. Finally, you can see a third <script> element containing an anonymous function that runs when the page has loaded.
6. Inside that function, a standard jQuery selector picks the containing <div> element that contains the accordion (using the value of its id 
attribute). The accordion functionality is triggered by calling the .accordion() method on that selection. -->
